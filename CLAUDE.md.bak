# Disciplo - Community Platform MVP

Community platform with web onboarding, built with Go, PocketBase, and Telegram Bot API.

## Vision

Create a community platform that uses a webapp access control, organization, and content management -> messaging with Telegram. The community is formed with members and telegram private groups through a bot-as-gatekeeper approach.

- memberful

## Phase 0: Webapp admin dashboard

- PocketBase integration for data persistence (always use pocketbase go sdk api if possible)
- .env file is used for setup
- Auto-create PocketBase collections with proper schemas
- Auto-create first admin from .env
- SMTP email integration via PocketBase (config from .env)
- Organized and modular codebase
- Bot template system externalized
- Basic bot structure with modular architecture
- Admin dashboard with:
    * profile page (with connect to telegram button -> token deeplink in /start to connect admin with telegram_id)
    * groups page (will be connected later by the bot)
    * members page (all members -> phase 2 for the onboarding)
- pocketbase collections (list of minimal fields):
- users:
    * name
    * email
    * password
    * created (date)
    * json with fields defined later
    * admin (bool; only admin=true can access admin dashboard)
    * group_admin (-> record groups; array of groups where member is admin)
    * groups (-> record grousp; array of groups where member belongs to)
    * status (pending; accepted)
    * verified (bool, verified=true when telegram_id is filled)
    * telegram_id
    * telegram_name (telegram handle)
- communities:
    * name
    * description
    * created (date)
    * telegram_id (this is sent from bot, once bot becomes admin, do it in phase 3)
    * type (general | local | special)

**Overview PocketBase Collections:**
- `users` - Member profiles with group membership and status
- `communities` - Community metadata with general/local group flags
- `requests` - Pending member requests with admin approval workflow

## Phase 1: Telegram group creation and linking


### Phase 2: Webapp member onboarding

- disciplo.toml as config file for config
- Multi-step web registration form with file uploads
- steps are configured in disciplo.conf
- Member dashboard:
    * Profile management interface
    * View all members list and profiles
    * View list of own groups
    * Search for members by name/location

### Phase 3: Web Frontend Development (3-4 weeks)

**Member Dashboard**

**Web Features**
- Responsive design with vanilla JS/Alpine.js
- Member directory with search and filters
- Document management (battleplans, logbooks)
- Profile editing and viewing
- Group information and statistics

**Authentication**
- Web session management
- Integration with Telegram bot authentication
- Secure access to personal and group data

### Phase 4: Payment Integration (2-3 weeks)

**Payment Options (Phase 4 Decision)**
- Option A: Web-based Stripe integration
- Option B: Telegram-native payments
- Automatic access control based on payment status
- Auto-kick users with expired payments

**Payment Commands (Private Chat Only)**
- `/subscribe [group]` - Purchase access
- `/billing` - Manage subscriptions

## Onboarding Flow (Web-First Implementation)

1. **Web Registration**: User fills multi-step form on `/register` with name, email, location, message, profile photo
2. **Admin Notification**: Email sent to admin with member request details and approval link (`/approve?token=...`)
3. **Admin Approval**: Admin clicks email link or uses admin dashboard to approve request
4. **Member Creation**: Approved request creates member record with `status: pending` in auth collection
5. **Secure Token Generation**: System creates `linking_tokens` record with 2-week expiry
6. **Onboarding Email**: User receives email with secure web link (`/link-telegram?token=...`)
7. **Secure Account Linking**: User clicks link → sees confirmation page with name/email → authenticates via Telegram Login Widget with HMAC verification
8. **Account Activation**: System links Telegram ID to member record and sets `status: active`
9. **Community Access**: User receives invite links to join default group and explore local communities via web dashboard
10. **Full Platform Access**: Member can access web dashboard, join/leave communities, manage profile - no bot interaction required

**Security Features**:
- Dual-token system: separate approval tokens and linking tokens
- HMAC-SHA256 verification for Telegram authentication
- One-time use tokens with automatic expiration (2 weeks)
- No email addresses in URL parameters (prevents manipulation)
- Secure web-first workflow eliminates bot complexity for users

## Group Structure

- **General Group**: Super group where all active members belong
- **Local Groups**: Exclusive membership (one at a time per user)
- **Local-admin**: One per local group, rotates every 2-3 months

## Architecture Decisions

**Web-First Design**: User onboarding and management happens primarily through web interface, not bot interactions

**Secure Token System**: Dual-token architecture with separate approval and linking tokens, all with expiration and one-time use

**Telegram Login Widget**: Official Telegram authentication with HMAC-SHA256 verification for secure account linking

**Bot Commands**: Admin-only commands in private chat; users interact via web dashboard

**Bot Role in Groups**: Admin for moderation and invite link generation only

**Local-Admin System**: Rotating leadership (2-3 months), one per group

**Admin Privileges**: Only admins can create groups, all admins auto-added as Telegram group admins

**Content Ownership**: Battleplans are personal, logbooks are group-level (local-admin only)

**Web Interface**: Primary user interface for all member functionality including profile management, community access, and content creation

## Automated Enforcement Rules

### Group Membership Management

**Default Group Requirement**
- Default group membership is **mandatory** for all community access
- When bot is added to first group → automatically becomes Default Group
- All existing members automatically get `in_default_group = true`
- All members added to Default Group `members_list`

**Local Group Restrictions**
- Members can belong to **only one local group** at a time
- Joining local group while in another is **automatically blocked**
- Local group membership updates `current_local_group_id`
- Members tracked in local group's `members_list`

**Default Group Exit Enforcement**
- **Automatic kick**: Member leaves default group → immediately kicked from ALL other groups
- **Complete cleanup**: All group associations cleared (`current_local_group_id`, `local_admin_since`)
- **Database sync**: Removed from all community `members_list` arrays
- **Access revocation**: Cannot rejoin any groups without default group access

### Bot Admin Status Management

**Community Creation**
- Bot promoted to admin → automatically creates community record in database
- First group becomes Default Group, subsequent groups are Local Groups
- Community includes `members_list` tracking all group members
- Automatic member enrollment for existing registered users

**Community Removal**  
- Bot removed as admin → **completely deletes community record**
- **Member cleanup**: All associated member flags cleared
- **Database integrity**: Removes all `members_list` associations
- **Default group removal**: If Default Group removed → ALL members lose community access

**Member Join/Leave Tracking**
- New member joins group → added to community `members_list` + flag updates
- Member leaves group → removed from `members_list` + flag cleanup  
- Telegram events automatically sync with database state

### Group Type Behaviors

| Group Type | Creation | Member Join | Member Leave | Bot Removed |
|------------|----------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Default Group** | Sets `default=true`, enrolls all members | Sets `in_default_group=true` | **Kicks from all groups** | **Locks out all members** |
| **Local Groups** | Sets `default=false` | Sets `current_local_group_id`, blocks multi-membership | Clears `current_local_group_id` | Clears local associations |

### Database Collections Enforcement

**members**
- `in_default_group` (bool) - Default group membership status
- `current_local_group_id` (nullable) - One local group maximum  
- `local_admin_since` (nullable) - Local admin appointment date

**communities**  
- `default` (bool) - Distinguishes Default Group from Local Groups
- `members_list` (relation array) - Live tracking of all group members
- `telegram_chat_id` - Links database record to Telegram group

### Automated Logging

**Group Operations**
- `✅ Community created for group: [Name] (ID: [ChatID])`
- `✅ Updated X members for default group`  
- `🗑️ Community removed for group: [Name] (ID: [ChatID])`

**Member Operations**
- `✅ Member [name] joined community [group]`
- `✅ Updated member [name] current_local_group_id to [id]`
- `✅ Kicked member [name] from group [group]` 
- `✅ Member [name] kicked from X groups after leaving default group`

**Critical Events**
- `⚠️ DEFAULT GROUP REMOVED - All members lose default group access!`
- `Warning: Member [name] is already in local group [group], cannot join [other]`

## Email and Message Templates

### Email Templates System ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

Email templates are now externalized and customizable:

**Location**: `src/static/email_templates/`
- `admin_invitation.html` - Welcome email sent to admin on startup
- `admin_notification.html` - New member request notification
- `user_onboarding.html` - Welcome email sent to approved users

**Features**:
- Go template syntax with data interpolation
- Fallback to hardcoded templates if file not found
- Templates copied to `build/pb_public/email_templates/` during build
- Admins can customize email content without code changes

**Template Variables Available**:
- `{{.Subject}}` - Email subject line
- `{{.UserName}}` - Member name
- `{{.AdminEmail}}` - Admin email address
- `{{.BotUsername}}` - Telegram bot username
- `{{.Token}}` - Registration token
- `{{.ApprovalLink}}` - Admin approval link

### 🚧 **TODO: Externalize Bot Messages and Menus**

**CRITICAL**: Bot messages and command responses are currently hardcoded in Go code. This needs to be externalized for customization:

**Required Implementation**:
1. **Bot Message Templates**
   - Create `src/static/bot_templates/` directory
   - Template files for each command response
   - Welcome messages, help text, error messages
   - Command descriptions and usage instructions

2. **Bot Menu System**
   - Externalize command descriptions
   - Help text and usage examples
   - Error messages and validation text
   - Multi-language support preparation

3. **Locations to Update**:
   - `src/bot/user.go` - Welcome messages, help text
   - `src/bot/admin.go` - Admin command responses
   - `src/main.go` - Default command responses
   - All hardcoded message strings throughout bot package

1. **Benefits**:
   - Community admins can customize bot personality
   - Easy localization/translation support
   - Consistent message formatting
   - No code changes needed for text updates

## Known Issues & Technical Debt

### 🐛 **Critical Bugs**
- `/requests` and `/members` commands fail with "invalid sort field created"  
- `/profile edit` command does nothing (needs implementation)
- `/help` alias `/?` not working properly
- Database query errors due to incorrect field names
- Email sending not using PocketBase official methods

### 🔧 **Technical Debt**
- Admin name hardcoded as "admin" (should use ADMIN_NAME from .env)
- Collection field `created_by_member` should be `created_by` with proper relation
- Missing admin commands in `/help` when user is admin
- No command completion/autocomplete in Telegram
- Hardcoded bot username in templates (should be configurable)
- Missing error handling in many bot commands
